## Overview & Problem Statement

### The Problem

Traditional web forms and text-based surveys often suffer from low engagement and completion rates. They can feel impersonal and fail to capture the nuance and detail present in natural human conversation, leading to superficial feedback.

### The Solution

This **Voice AI Survey Tool** transforms the survey experience by replacing static forms with dynamic, voice-driven conversations. An AI agent, powered by OpenAI Realtime models, engages users in a natural dialogue, asking predefined questions and capturing their spoken responses in real-time. This approach makes feedback collection more engaging, accessible, and capable of gathering richer, more detailed insights.

**Data Flow:**

1.  **Admin**: An admin logs in via Google OAuth, configures the survey settings (prompts, questions, voice) in the React dashboard, and saves them.
2.  **End-User**: A user visits the survey page, starts the session, and the frontend obtains a ephemeral key from the backend and establishes a real-time connection with the OpenAI API.
3.  **Conversation**: The AI agent powered by OpenAI's [GPT Realtime Model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-realtime) configured with the admin's settings, initiates a conversation.
4.  **Transcript Logging**: The entire conversation transcript is saved to the database for later review by the admin.

### Folder Structure

The project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo and Bun Workspaces.

## Local Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/docs/installation): v1.2.20 or later.
- [**OpenAI API Key**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CW-Codewalnut/voice-ai-tool.git
    cd voice-ai-tool
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script**
    This command will install all dependencies, copy the example `.env` files, and run the initial database migration & seed the DB with a sample system settings.

    ```bash
    bun setup
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    The `bun setup` script creates `.env` files in `apps/api` and `apps/web`. You must fill them with your credentials.

    **Backend** ([`apps/api/.env`](apps/api/.env))
    | Variable | Description | Example |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | `APP_PORT` | Port for the backend server. | `5000` |
    | `APP_URL` | Full public URL of the backend. | `http://localhost:5000` |
    | `ADMIN_EMAILS` | Semicolon-separated list of admin email addresses who can access admin features. | `admin@example.com;admin2@example.com` |
    | `CORS_ORIGIN_1` | The URL of your frontend app to allow CORS. | `http://localhost:3000` |
    | `DATABASE_URL` | Turso DB URL or local file path. | `file:./.database/local.db` |
    | `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` | Turso auth token (leave blank for local file DB). | `your-turso-token` |
    | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Google OAuth Client ID. | `your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com` |
    | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Google OAuth Client Secret. | `your-google-client-secret` |
    | `AUTH_SECRET` | A long, random secret for signing auth tokens. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. | `a_very_long_and_random_secret_string` |
    | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key. | `sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |

    **Frontend** ([`apps/web/.env`](apps/web/.env))
    | Variable | Description | Example |

4.  **Start the Development Servers**
    This command uses Turborepo to start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    - API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`
    - Web app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`
